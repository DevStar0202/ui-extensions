  use to build an interface. This UI is rendered natively by Shopify, so you
  can depend on it to be performant, accessible, and work in all of Checkoutâ€™s
  supported browsers. \n\nThe following components are available as part of Argo
  for Checkout, but make sure that you check the documentation for your
  [extension point](${paths.shopifyDevUrl}/extension-points#extension-points)
  to ensure the component is available in the extension points you are
  targeting.`,
